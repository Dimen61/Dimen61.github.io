> There are some fish that cannot be caught. It's not that they're faster or than other fish.They're just touched by something extra.

> Now, I was in a situation.I could gut that fish and get my wedding ring back……but in doing so I'd be killing the smartest catfish in the Ashton River.Did I want to deprive my son the chance……to catch a fish like this of his own？This ladyfish and I…Well, we had the same destiny. - "We were part of the same equation."

> why did it strike so quick on gold when nothing else would attract it？

> That was the lesson I learned that day…Sometimes the only way to catch an uncatchable woman…is to offer her a wedding ring.

> We were like strangers who knew each other very well.

> In telling the story of my father's life……it's impossible to separate fact from fiction, the man from the myth.The best I can do is to tell it the way he told me.

> His birth would set the pace for his unlikely life.

> I was thinking about death and all. About seeing how you're gonna die.I mean, on one hand, if dying was all you thought about……it could kind of screw you up.But it could kind of help you, couldn't it？Because, everything else, you'd know you could survive.((说完女巫笑了,认为这个孩子有智慧))I guess I'm saying I'd like to know.（女巫一脸惊讶，被这个孩子的勇气震惊，有智慧并不容易，再拥有勇气更是非凡。）

俏皮话
>You are in for a surprise. - Am I？
>Having a kid changes everything.There's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feeding.
>Did you do any of that？ - No.But I hear it's terrible.Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child…fill its head with nonsense, and still it turns out perfectly fine.
>You think I'm up for it？ - You learned from the best.
>Drink half the can. I'll tell Mom you drank it all.Everyone wins.
>People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet.

>I was never much for being at home, Will. Too confining.And this here, being stuck in bed…Dying is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.

>So I spent the better part of three years confined to my bed……with the encyclopedia being my only means of exploration.I had made it all the way to the G's…hoping to find an answer to my "gigantificationism"…when I uncovered an article about the common goldfish."Kept in a small bowl, the goldfish will remain small.With more space……the fish will grow double, triple, or quadruple its size."It occurred to me then that perhaps the reason for my growth……was that I was intended for larger things.After all, a giant man can't have an ordinary-sized life.As soon as my bones had settled in their adult configuration…I set upon my plan to make a bigger place for myself in Ashton.

>There were two roads out of Ashton:A new one which was paved and an older one that wasn't.People didn't use the old one anymore……and it had developed a reputation for being haunted.Well, since I had no intention of ever returning to Ashton…this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old one.

>Now, there comes a point when a reasonable man…will swallow his pride and admit that he's made a terrible mistake.The truth is, I was never a reasonable man.And what I recall of Sunday school was that……the more difficult something is, the more rewarding it is in the end.

>You must've taken a shortcut. - Why, yes, I did. It almost killed me.
>Life will do that to you. And truthfully, the long way is easier.
>But it's longer. - Much longer.
